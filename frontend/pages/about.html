      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Youth diabetes has become a critical public health crisis in the United States. According to the CDC, <strong>1 in 3 teens aged 12-17 (totaling 8.4 million) have prediabetes</strong>, and type 2 diabetes cases are projected to increase by <strong>700% by 2060</strong>.</p>
      <p>We created YouthDiabetes.AI to address this growing challenge by combining advanced machine learning risk prediction with generative AI-powered personalized recommendations. Our mission is to empower young people and their families with early detection tools and actionable insights to prevent or manage diabetes.</p>

      <h1>How AI Can Help</h1>
      <p>Generative AI is reshaping how people live, work, and stay healthy, with notable effects on physical and mental well-being. In healthcare, it can help doctors make better diagnoses, tailor treatments to individual patients, and accelerate drug discovery, potentially improving outcomes and lowering costs for patients and systems alike.</p>
      <p>Generative AI can also reduce administrative burdens on clinicians, giving them more time for direct care, and enhance access to health information for patients.</p>
      <p>At the same time, these technologies pose health risks if used improperly. AI can give inaccurate or misleading medical or mental health advice, which may delay necessary professional care and harm outcomes, and suffers from "hallucinations" and bias that affect vulnerable populations. Chatbots used for mental health support might increase access but also raise concerns about empathy, crisis response, and overreliance without clinician oversight.</p>
      <p><strong>Overall, generative AI can support healthier lives when integrated responsibly</strong> with strong governance, ethical standards, and collaboration with healthcare professionals, ensuring benefits without compromising safety.</p>
