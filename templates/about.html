      <h1>Youth Diabetes Crisis</h1>
      <p class="muted">Youth diabetes represents one of the most pressing public health crises facing American families today. Diabetes among youth in the United States has increased significantly over the last two decades; from 2001 to 2017, 
        the number of youth living with Type 1 diabetes increased by 45%, while the number of youth living with Type 2 diabetes nearly doubled, increasing by 95%. If current trends continue, the number of young people with diabetes could increase as much as <strong>700%</strong> by 2060,
        particularly for Type 2. </p>
      <p>Most alarmingly, <strong>one in three American teenagers</strong>, ages 12-19, has prediabetes, according to CDC research. Prediabetes represents adolescents with blood glucose levels higher than usual but not yet high enough to be classified as Type 2 diabetes.  That’s over <strong>8.4 million</strong> young people on a dangerous path toward a lifetime of chronic disease!</p>

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>YouthDiabetes.AI was created to tackle the growing youth diabetes crisis by making AI-powered health tools
        accessible to everyone. Our goal is to empower young people and their families with early risk detection and
        actionable guidance, completely free and available to anyone with internet access.</p>
      <p>This project combines two powerful AI approaches: <strong>machine learning for risk prediction</strong> and
        <strong>generative AI for personalized recommendations</strong>, transforming complex health data into an
        easy-to-understand tool for the public.
      </p>

      <h1>Technical Approach</h1>
      <h4>Machine Learning Risk Prediction</h4>
      <p>Our prediction model was trained on the most recent comprehensive youth diabetes dataset from Mount Sinai
        School of Medicine, released in July 2024. This dataset draws from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
        Survey (NHANES), incorporating health indicators from national surveys spanning 1999-2018 and covering over
        15,000 individuals aged 12-19.</p>
      <p>The development process involved extensive data preparation, a hybrid feature selection pipeline that reduced
        over 100 variables to approximately 30-40 key predictors, and evaluation of multiple algorithms including
        XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. All models were assessed using weighted metrics to
        ensure accuracy across diverse populations.</p>

      <h4>Generative AI Recommendations</h4>
      <p>Once risk factors are identified, generative AI creates personalized daily meal plans, weekly exercise
        schedules, and practical lifestyle recommendations tailored specifically to each user's profile. The system is
        carefully engineered to provide actionable guidance while avoiding specific medical claims.</p>
      <p>To ensure accuracy, AI outputs were validated using the LLM-as-a-Judge method, where we cross-checked responses
        across
        multiple AI systems (ChatGPT, Deepseek, Gemini, Grok) to verify consistency and accuracy for general lifestyle
        guidance.</p>

      <h1>Responsible AI in Healthcare</h1>
      <p>AI is transforming healthcare by enabling better diagnoses, personalized treatments, and improved patient
        outcomes. However, these technologies require careful implementation. AI can produce inaccurate information and
        suffers from biases that affect vulnerable populations.</p>
      <p>YouthDiabetes.AI is designed with responsibility in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Educational focus:</strong> We provide general health guidance, not medical diagnoses</li>
        <li><strong>Complementary care:</strong> We encourage users to work with healthcare professionals</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible design:</strong> Free and easy to understand for users of all health literacy levels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When integrated responsibly with strong governance and collaboration with healthcare professionals, AI can
        support healthier lives without compromising safety.</p>
